# A-Boring-Game
A JavaScript game (built using p5.js repos) similar to Galaga, if it was boring and had a story (a bad one, but story nonetheless.)

Has a menu to enable music from a set selection, and change the volume, as well as levels that progressively add more enemies.

Sadly, the game didn't make it past alpha as it was such a good idea that it had it's funding canceled.
